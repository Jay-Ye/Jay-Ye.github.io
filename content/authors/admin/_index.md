:four_leaf_clover: I am an (incoming) CS PhD student at USC, advised by [Prof. Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/). I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) with the highest honor **Academic Pioneer**, where I worked in [Vision4robotics Group](https://vision4robotics.github.io/) directed by [Prof. Changhong Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmbMZ4kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I have been fortunate to spend time at [CVG Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) in ETHz (under [ETH RSF 2022](https://center-for-robotics.ethz.ch/education/robotics-student-fellowship/2022-Robotics-Student-Fellows.html)), and [MARS Lab](http://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/) in [QiZhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/).

<!-- Since Jan. 2020, I have been working on intelligent visual perception for UAV supervised by [Prof. Changhong Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmbMZ4kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Starting from Apr. 2022, I have been a research student at [CVG Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/), ETHz, under the [ETH RSF program](https://center-for-robotics.ethz.ch/education/robotics-student-fellowship/2022-Robotics-Student-Fellows.html). In addition, I am collaborating closely with [Dr. Danda Pani Paudel](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~paudeld/) (Computer Vision Lab, ETHz) and [Prof. Geng Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geng-Lu-3) (UAV Lab, Tsinghua University). \
